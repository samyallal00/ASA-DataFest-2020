# ASA-DataFest-2020
This repository contains all the code written for the purpose of analyzing different datasets that my team and I have chosen for our DataFest presentation.

Files included & their corresponding datasets:

dataset_1.py          corresponds to    data_1.csv,

work_data.py          corresponds to    work_dataset.xlsx,

dataset_3.py          corresponds to    data_3.csv,

personal_dataset.py   corresponds to    personal.csv

Every python file will generate multiple graphs (present in the video) based on the data provided in each dataset.
At the bottom of each python file, you will find a section called "Extra graphs". This section represents graphs
that we thought might be useful to visualize but were not included in the video due to time restriction.

Important notes:

1- When running the python scripts, make sure to replace the path of the .csv or .xlsx datasets in the variable "filename"
   at the top of the file. If all the below files are in the same directory, no change is needed.
   
2- If you have any question on how to set-up the scripts, please do email me at: samyallal00@ucla.edu
